# Neural Network and Deep Learning Basics

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the use of a simple feedforward neural network to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. Unlike traditional machine learning, deep learning models automatically learn hierarchical features from raw image data, providing superior performance on complex visual tasks.

## Project Overview

### Dataset Preparation

- CIFAR-10 dataset with 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
- Images loaded using TensorFlow Keras utilities.
- Sample images visualized to understand class diversity.

### Image Preprocessing

- Pixel values normalized to [0, 1].
- Labels one-hot encoded for multi-class classification.
- Optional data augmentation applied (rotations, shifts, flips, zooms) to improve robustness.

### Neural Network Implementation

- Feedforward neural network with two hidden layers using ReLU activation.
- Output layer with Softmax activation for 10-class classification.
- Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss used.
- Model trained for 15 epochs with validation split.

### Model Evaluation

- Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
- Confusion matrix and classification report generated.
- Training and validation accuracy/loss plotted to monitor learning.

### Model Improvements

- Enhanced architecture with more layers and batch normalization.
- Trained with data augmentation to reduce overfitting.
- Extended training to 20 epochs.

### Application Demonstration

- Practical use cases include fashion retail item classification and digital media organization.
- Discussed deployment considerations: scalability, real-time processing, integration, and continuous learning.
